##  Scraping Strategy

Using `Playwright`, the scraper:
- Launches a **headless Chromium** session
- Injects cookies via `context.add_cookies()` for **login bypass**
- Navigates paginated job listings using `Next` button detection
- Extracts:
  - Job title  
  - Company  
  - Location  
  - Salary  
  - Post date
- Stores data into a **CSV** for cleaning

>  Auth Bypass:
> Simulated login once, then reused session by persisting cookies across scraping
runs.
